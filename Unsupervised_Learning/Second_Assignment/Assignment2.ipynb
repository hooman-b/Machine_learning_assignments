    "\n",
    "This week's focus is on manifold learning and text clustering. As part of the portfolio assignment, you are required to make a contribution to either the manifold learning case or the text clustering case. There are several options for your contribution, so you can choose the one that aligns with your learning style or interests the most\n",

    "\n",
    "### Manifold learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Study the Tutorial tutorial_manifold_tSNE and the tutorial_manifold_spectral_clustering and the Study_Case_pipeline. Next improve the code by comparing the performance of k-means and spectral clustering. Also compare PCA and t-SNE in the visualization of the result. You can use the pipeline function of scikit-learn and hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV. Here's a possible approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Load the dataset to be used for the clustering analysis.\n",
    "- Preprocess the dataset as needed (e.g., scale the features, normalize the data, etc.).\n",
    "- Define a pipeline with preprocessing and clustering\n",
    "- use PCA and t-SNE for dimension reduction and visualize the dimensions, use the clusters to color the datapoints\n",
    "- use GridSearchCV to optimize the hyper parameters\n",
    "- Evaluate the performance of the models using a suitable metric\n",
    "- choose the best cluster method and the best visualization method combination\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain choises and evaluate outcome. You can do this assignment in pairs but if you do so mention each others name. Do not forget to reference. If you cannot figure out how to use GridSearchCV and or a pipeline, use your own solution\n",

    "### Text clustering\n",

    "Read, execute and analyse the code in the notebook tutorial_clustering_words. Then *choose one* of the assignments a), b) or c). \n",

    "a) read the article Clinical Documents Clustering Based on Medication/Symptom Names Using Multi-View Nonnegative Matrix Factorization. you can find the article <a href = 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26011887/'> here</a>. Explain the similarities of this notebook and the article. Explain in your own words what need to be added to this notebook to reproduce the article. There is no need to code the solution, you can mention in your own words the steps. \n",
    "\n",
    "b) Improve the outcome improving the data preprocessing and the hyper parameter configurations. Explain your choices. Your solution should be a coded solution with comments. Are there any other weighting solutions next to TF-IDF?\n",

    "When I start to study for this assignment, I thought that text clustering is a boring topic in machine learning. We need to clean a dataset, then implement some techniques to extract a group of topics. However, when I dove deeply into this topic, I found it quite amusing and most importantly informative. Now I am in the situation that I do not know what dataset should I choose since I am quite curious to study about all the Kaggle datasets :). At the end I came up with a fascinating data set about the abstracts of articles in Quantum Physics that gathers all the abstarct of 72880 articles related to different section of this amusing field of science. Consequently, as a datascienctis-physicist, I rather to choose to work on this dataset to find what topics (fields) are hot-topics during 1992-2020 in the field of quantum mechanics.\n",
