    "This notebook uses a collection of clinical case reports to cluster words by topics using the NMF method. To cluster text we need to preprocess the text first with regular natural language processing cleaning steps such as remove punctuations, stopwords, or other unwanted text. we lower the text and use the lemma to reduce variation of words. This is all done in part A. \n",
    "\n",
    "Next we need to prepare the text in a document term matrix so that NMF can perform the calculations. The Document-Term Matrix (DTM) represents the frequency of words (or terms) in a collection of documents. Each row in the matrix represents a document, and each column represents a word in the vocabulary. The value in each cell represents the frequency of the corresponding word in the corresponding document. This is done in part B\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly we run the clustering algorithm and visualize the outcome. This is done in part C\n",

    "## The data \n",
    "A collection of 200 clinical case report documents in plain text format are used. The documents are named using PubMed document IDs, and have been edited to include only clinical case report details. The dataset is called \"MACCROBAT2020\" and is the second release of this dataset, with improvements made to the consistency and format of annotations\n",

Explain the similarities of this notebook and the article. Explain in your own words what need to be added to this notebook to reproduce the article. There is no need to code the solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "b) Improve the outcome improving the data preprocessing and the hyper parameter configurations. Explain your choices. Your solution should be a coded solution with comments. Are there any other weighting solutions next to TF-IDF?\n",

The value in each cell represents the frequency of the corresponding word in the corresponding document.\n",

    "In specific case below, the DTM has been created using only the nouns extracted from the original text, and has been transformed using the TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) weighting scheme. The TF-IDF scheme assigns weights to words based on how often they appear in a document relative to how often they appear in the entire corpus. Words that appear frequently in a document but infrequently in the corpus are given higher weights, as they are considered to be more important for distinguishing that document from others in the corpus. This weighting scheme is commonly used in text mining and information retrieval to identify key terms or topics in a collection of documents.\n",
